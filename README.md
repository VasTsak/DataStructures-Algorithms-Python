# Data Structures & Algorithms (in Python)

This repository is divided into 4 parts. 

## 0. Unscramble CS

This folder contains some exercises (with solutions) on using python programmin for common problems. It requires no data stucture & algorithm prior knowledge

## 1. Data structures

We will solve the following problems using data structures:

#### 1. Implement a least recent used cache
#### 2. Find all the files with a given suffix
#### 3. Implement the Hoffman encoding
#### 4. Implment Windows Active Directory
#### 5. Impliment a blockchain 
#### 6. Find the union and intersection between those two linked lists

## 3. Basic Algorithms

#### 1. Finding the Square Root of an Integer
#### 2. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
#### 3. Implement the Hoffman encoding
#### 4. Dutch National Flag Problem
#### 5. Autocomplete with Tries 
#### 6. Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
#### 7. HTTPRouter using a Trie

## 4. Advanced Algorithms
