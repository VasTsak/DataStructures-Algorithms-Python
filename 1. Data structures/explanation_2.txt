The first step is to initialize a list where we will store the directories containing the file with the selected suffix.

Then we will create a for loop where we iterate though all the objects at the current directory, if the current object
ends with the required suffix, we append the directory to the list we initialized before, else we try to call the function
we created (recursion) where we use as path the directory of the current object we are at the time of iterative process, if the
recursive function won't return something we continue the for loop.

The big O notation of this process is O(n) both for time and space complexity where n is the number of objects
we need to scan / store.
