We create a Block class (at its core is a linked list) where we initialize it with the timestamp,
data, previous hash and current hash. We also create three methods. The first method will calculate
the hash based on the data the block contains, the set_previous_hash method will assign the previous hash
to the current block and the get_hash returns the current hash of the block.

Finally we create a function outside the class where we create the links among the blocks.
We assign the current block as the next block from the previous block and we assign the hash
from the previous block to the 'previous_hash' attribute to the current block.

The big o notation of this script is O(n) where n is the number of blocks we want to have
in the chain. It is a straight forward process where we just insert block to the linked list.
The space complexity of this program is also O(n) where n is the number of blocks.
